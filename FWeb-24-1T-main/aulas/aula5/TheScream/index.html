        <h1>The Scream</h1>
        <h3>The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is a series of four paintings by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, from 1893.
            The work depicts an androgynous figure in a moment of deep anguish and despair. The background is the dock
            of the Oslo Fjord (in Oslo) at sunset. The Scream is considered one of the most important works of the
            Expressionist movement and has acquired the status of a cultural icon, on a par with Leonardo da Vinci's
            Mona Lisa.
            The series has four known paintings: two of the paintings in the series, "Anxiety" (Norwegian: Angst) and
            "Despair" (Norwegian: Fortvielse) are held by the Munch Museum in Oslo, another by the National Gallery in
            Oslo and another by a private collection.[1] In 2012, the latter became the most expensive painting in
            history, selling for $119.9 million at auction.[2]
